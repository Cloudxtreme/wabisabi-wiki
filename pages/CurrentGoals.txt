: "nothing lasts, nothing is finished, and nothing is perfect" -- http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wabi-sabi

== What WabiSabi is

; **clean** : Any feature that involves complex logic is right out.
; **concise** : It is the author's opinion that sprawling code is as bad as obfuscated code.
; **useful** : That said, minimalism for the sake of it doesn't help anyone. There should be a balance.

== What WabiSabi isn't

; **complete** : Other WikiEngines include everything and the kitchen sink, not to mention an atoll or two plus a coral reef. That makes them harder to understand and use for anyone who //doesn't// need the extra features.
; **definitive** : These goals are likely to change over time and there's nothing wrong with that.

There are hundreds of WikiEngines out there, and WabiSabi draws inspiration from quite a few of them.

== Similar engines

* [http://www.pawfal.org/pawfaliki/ Pawfaliki] should be the closest other engine out there, but isn't. Pawfaliki is almost 5 times as large as WabiSabi and skimps on markup in favor of various advanced features.
* [http://infomesh.net/pwyky/ Pwyky] is similar to Pawfaliki in size and features, except it's written in Python.
* WikiWikiWeb was the original wiki, and though it's written in Perl and with a different focus than WabiSabi, it is closer in spirit than the others.

== Major influences

While the original wiki's main selling point was technological in nature ("the simplest online database that can possibly work"), wikis have become famous mostly as a social phenomenon. Which they are, but as a result the technology side doesn't see much discussion, and that's too bad.

WabiSabi started as an attempt to see just how little one can get away with, both in terms of features and of code size. Turns out, a lot can be done with very little. For example, conventional wisdom holds that stateless wiki parsers can only implement a simplistic syntax. WabiSabi proves the contrary, with a 70-line stateless parser that offers most of the syntax from much larger wikis, and is extensible on top of that.

Many people on the original wiki discussed wiki technology -- the most obvious were new features that "obviously need to be added"; but some people found it more interesting to simplify the software and see what features that could be left out.
(For example,
[http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?ShortestWikiContest the shortest wiki contest]
).
However, such [http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?WikiOnWiki wiki-on-wiki meta-discussion] is off-topic on the original wiki;
which led to such discussion being deleted and lost forever :-( or pushed to some other wiki -- such as the WabiSabi website (not to be confused with the WabiSabi WikiEngine ).

If you are asking what license this software is released under, you are asking the wrong question.

The archive may lag behind the online version at times. Be patient. Better yet, contact me. :)

Please keep in mind that WabiSabi was created out of academic curiosity. It may or may not be suitable for a production website. Especially as it's little used, so it may well have bugs and security holes. That said, I //am// trying to make it useful, so feel free to leave QuestionsAndFeedback. Also check out the RoadMap.

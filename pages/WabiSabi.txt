WabiSabi is a fast experimental Wiki engine in 275 lines of PHP. The FeatureSet places it in the same ballpark as the original WikiWikiWeb, only with a modern bent. The name comes from a Japanese aesthetic that is reflected in the project's CurrentGoals.

This website is also about WikiEngines and WikiTechnology in general. It is an open wiki, as it should be. If in doubt, see WhenToContribute. The WikiSandbox will give you an idea of the supported syntax.

Well here's a feedback: This Wikisoftware just rocks! :D Thanks!

Believe it or not, I didn't write that. :P -- FelixPlesoianu

I really like the simplicity of WabiSabi and am experimenting with it now, for possible use as a website. Question: what's the plan for development, updates, etc.? I don't want to go down a dead-end street. :) --Randal

I'm afraid WabiSabi was a one-off experiment, Randal. I don't have any plans for further development. But I'd be happy to talk about it. -- FelixPlesoianu

Sorry to hear there are no plans for development, Felix. But I understand the idea of the experiment. -- Randal

I have a WikiWord that isn't being interpreted correctly by the software: NT-Ga4_12-20 . The last zero isn't being accepted as a part of the link. What's going on here?

A: Looks like a bug! I'll try to look one of these days (as of 2011-11-11). No promises though, life's busy. Drop me an e-mail, and I'll let you know.

In the main file, only 1-9 were defined as possible digits for a WikiWord. I know almost nothing about code and all that, but I changed it to 0-9 and it worked. :) BTW, didn't see an email for you anywhere, so I just popped in here. -- Randal

My e-mail is at the top of the file you just changed. Good catch, by the way, I'll publish a fixed version soon.

Hi, Felix, here's an application for WabiSabi that would rock the boat: A WordPress plug-in. The ones I see are either commercial and very limited, or not desirable for some reason.

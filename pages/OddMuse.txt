A descendant of UseMod, itself one of the oldest WikiEngines, OddMuse is a one-file lightweight engine written in Perl. Notable features are FlatFileStorage and built-in blogging support.

Installing and managing OddMuse requires some knowledge of Perl. The engine is highly extensible, but looks are customized almost exclusively via CSS, as changing the HTML requires writing an extension.
